# Preparing Fugu
The main point of preparing fugu is to remove all signs of tetrodotoxin, 
which is generally found everywhere but the flesh. 

Tetrodotoxin is rapid and violent, causing numbness around the mouth, paralysis and finally death. 
It is said to be 1,000 times more potent than cyanide and there is of course no antidote.

While the preparation of fugu should be left to professionals and you should definitely not try this at home, 
it’s interesting to know what steps the chefs need to follow to ensure the fugu is safe for eating.

## Step 1
Remove the skin (there are no scales). Cut around the mouth and from there, pull the skin off.

## Step 2
Wash off the jelly using salt.

## Step 3
Remove the eyes.

## Step 4
Using a good, sharp knife, gut the fish being very careful not to puncture the ovaries or liver.
Should these burst, the toxins will be released into the flesh making the fish inedible.

Under no circumstance should you feed this to someone! It will kill them (see above)!

## Step 5
Cutting against the bone, fillet as you would any other sashimi.

## Step 6
Cut the head into two or three pieces and boil. This can be used for a stew.

Fugu is definitely the type of delicacy that people travel to try – just make sure if you do try it, 
it’s been prepared correctly by someone with the right training.
